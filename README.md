## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This app starts by dynamically creating a 16x16 grid of square divs which represents the sketchpad that the user can draw on. The user can change the size of the grid using range input. The layout type used for the grid of squares is CSS Grid. Whenever the user hovers over the sketchpad the div itself changes color. The user has many different color options to choose from and can clear the sketchpad as well.

## Optimizations:

I would like to try to add event delegation to the container that holds all the divs instead of adding an event listener to each div. I would also like to refactor the project and use OOP best practices and maybe make a mobile responsive version.

## Lessons Learned:

This was another great project to practice DOM manipulation. I also figured out how to dynamically create elements on the page which makes things easier because it would have been annoying to create the 16x16 grid divs by hand.
